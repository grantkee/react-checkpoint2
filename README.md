# Checkpoint 2 - Local Business Listings

## Goal

For this project, I created a site for users to find local restaurants. If the login button is clicked, the user is able to add and delete business listings. Without logging in, a user can click details on a restaurant and see it on a map using the Google Maps API.

### Future Additions

I want to connect the listings to an API instead of using an array in my Redux state.js. I'm also going to improve styling, add authentication, and rearrange some of the routes.
